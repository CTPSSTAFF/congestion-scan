Big data query of INRIX data in a web browser (proof-of-concept)
This project aims to allow the Central Transportation Planning Staff to query Big Query-hosted INRIX traffic data via a user-friendly web interface. We anticipate relying on three principal frameworks:
* d3 javascript library for visualization of retrieved data
* Google Big Query API for querying the data
* jQuery javascript library for web page interface elements
